    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>GiveProtocol ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our blockchain-based philanthropic platform and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>
    <p>We value your privacy and recognize the sensitivity of personal data. While blockchain technology enables transparency in donations and volunteer contributions, we've designed our platform to balance transparency with appropriate privacy protections.</p>
    <div class="notice">
        <p class="emphasis">IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR OUR TERMS OF USE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE SERVICES.</p>
    </div>
    <p>If you provide personal data to us, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of such personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide the personal data of another individual (such as organization representatives or volunteer references), it means that you have informed them of the purposes for which we require their personal data and they have consented to the collection, use, and disclosure of their personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
    <p>We collect information you provide directly to us when you:</p>

        <li>Register as a charitable organization</li>
        <li>Register as a volunteer</li>
        <li>Post volunteer opportunities</li>
        <li>Process donations</li>

        <li>Tracking Data from cookies and similar technologies</li>

        <li>Transaction amounts</li>
        <li>Transaction timestamps</li>

    <h3>2.4 Information We Will Never Collect</h3>
    <div class="notice">
        <p class="emphasis">We will never ask you to share your private keys or wallet seed. Never trust anyone or any site that asks you to enter your private keys or wallet seed.</p>

    <h3>2.5 Aggregated and Anonymized Data</h3>
