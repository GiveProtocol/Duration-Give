        <p>Welcome to the Give Protocol decentralized application ("dApp"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and Give Protocol Foundation ("Give Protocol," "Company," "we," "us," or "our") governing your access to and use of the Give Protocol dApp, including all related services, features, content, and functionality (collectively, the "Platform" or "Services").</p>
        
        <p>By accessing or using the Services in any way, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms. If you don't agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.</p>
        
        <p class="important">PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. They cover important information about Services provided to you and any charges we bill you. These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, limitations of liability, a class action waiver, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.</p>
        
        <p class="highlight important">ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>

        <p>If you don't agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms will govern our relationship with you.</p>

        <h2><strong>5. CRYPTOCURRENCY DONATIONS</strong></h2>
        
        <h3><strong>5.1 Transaction Execution</strong></h3>
        
        <p>All cryptocurrency donations are executed through smart contracts deployed on blockchain networks. Once initiated, transactions cannot be reversed or refunded except as required by applicable law.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>5.2 Role of Give Protocol</strong></h3>
        
        <p>Give Protocol Foundation, as a not-for-profit charitable organization, connects charitable organizations with those looking to donate cryptocurrency and other assets. When we use the word "you" in these Terms, it refers to any user, regardless of whether you are a donor or using the Services on behalf of a charitable organization, while if we use one of those specific terms, it only applies to that category of user.</p>
        
        <p>Where applicable take steps to confirm each potential charitable organization is a registered nonprofit organization. However, each donor must make its own determinations that an organization available through our Service is suitable for such donor. Give Protocol is only responsible for connecting organizations and donors, and is not responsible for the use of any donations.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>5.3 Transaction Fees</strong></h3>
        
        <p>You are responsible for all transaction fees associated with donations, including:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>- Blockchain network fees (gas fees)</li>
            <li>- Any platform fees as disclosed prior to transaction execution</li>
            <li>- Any currency conversion fees</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><strong>5.4 Donation Confirmation</strong></h3>
        
        <p>A donation is considered complete only upon confirmation on the relevant blockchain network. We are not responsible for donations that fail to complete due to network issues, insufficient funds, or other technical problems.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>5.5 Tax Implications</strong></h3>
        
        <p>You are solely responsible for determining the tax implications of your donations. The Platform may provide donation receipts, but these are not guaranteed to satisfy tax authority requirements in all jurisdictions.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>5.6 Donation Risks</strong></h3>
        
        <p>You acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency donations, including but not limited to:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>- Price volatility that may affect the value of your donation</li>
            <li>- Regulatory uncertainty regarding cryptocurrency donations</li>
            <li>- Security vulnerabilities in blockchain networks</li>
            <li>- Technical failures that could prevent donations from reaching their intended recipients</li>
            <li>- Permanent loss of assets due to user error</li>

            <li>- Control the actions of charitable organizations</li>
            <li>- Guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of volunteer opportunities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><strong>6.2 User Conduct as Volunteers</strong></h3>
        
        <p>When using the Platform to find or fulfill volunteer opportunities, you agree to:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>- Provide accurate information about your skills, availability, and qualifications</li>

            <li>- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations</li>
        </ul>
