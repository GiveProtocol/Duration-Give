/*
  # Add withdrawal requests functionality

  1. New Tables
    - `withdrawal_requests`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `charity_id` (uuid, references profiles)
      - `amount` (numeric)
      - `status` (text: pending, approved, rejected)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)
      - `processed_at` (timestamptz)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `withdrawal_requests` table
    - Add policies for charities to manage their withdrawal requests
    - Add trigger to ensure only charity profiles can request withdrawals
