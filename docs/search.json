const wallet = await generateWallet({ currency: 'BTC', type: 'hierarchical-deterministic', derivationPath: \"m/44'/0'/0'/0/0\" }); // Returns { address: '1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa', publicKey: '04678afdb0fe5548...', derivationPath: \"m/44'/0'/0'/0/0\", qrCode: 'data:image/png;base64,...' } ``` ### Address Management **HD Wallet Structure:** ``` Master Seed ├── Organization Wallets (m/44'/0'/0') │ ├── Org 1 (m/44'/0'/0'/0) │ │ ├── Donation Address 1 (m/44'/0'/0'/0/0) │ │ ├── Donation Address 2 (m/44'/0'/0'/0/1) │ │ └── ... │ └── Org 2 (m/44'/0'/0'/1) └── Platform Wallets (m/44'/0'/1') ``` ### Transaction Monitoring **Blockchain Monitoring Service:** ```javascript // WebSocket connection for real-time updates const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.give.io/crypto/monitor'); ws.on('message', (data) => { const transaction = JSON.parse(data); if (transaction.confirmations >= requiredConfirmations[transaction.currency]) { processDonation(transaction); } }); // Transaction structure { \"txId\": \"0x123abc...\", \"currency\": \"ETH\", \"amount\": \"0.5\", \"from\": \"0xabc123...\", \"to\": \"0xdef456...\", \"confirmations\": 12, \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\", \"status\": \"confirmed\" } ``` ## Integration Methods ### API Integration **Generate Donation Address:** ```http POST /api/v1/crypto/addresses Authorization: Bearer your_api_key Content-Type: application/json { \"organization_id\": \"org_123\", \"currency\": \"BTC\", \"amount\": 0.01, \"expires_in\": 3600, \"callback_url\": \"https://your-site.com/webhook\" } ``` **Response:** ```json { \"address\": \"bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh\", \"currency\": \"BTC\", \"amount\": 0.01, \"amount_usd\": 435.5, \"expires_at\": \"2024-01-15T11:30:00Z\", \"qr_code\": \"data:image/png;base64,...\", \"payment_uri\": \"bitcoin:bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh?amount=0.01\" } ``` ### SDK Implementation **JavaScript SDK:** ```javascript import { CryptoGateway } from \"@give-protocol/crypto-sdk\"; const gateway = new CryptoGateway({ apiKey: \"your_api_key\", environment: \"production\", }); // Create donation widget const widget = await gateway.createWidget({ organizationId: \"org_123\", currencies: [\"BTC\", \"ETH\", \"USDC\"], fiatAmount: 100, onSuccess: (transaction) => { console.log(\"Donation received:\", transaction); }, onError: (error) => { console.error(\"Donation failed:\", error); }, }); // Embed in page widget.mount(\"#crypto-donation-container\"); ``` ### Smart Contract Integration **Donation Contract (Ethereum):** ```solidity pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract GiveProtocolDonations { mapping(address => uint256) public organizationBalances; mapping(address => bool) public verifiedOrganizations; event DonationReceived( address indexed donor, address indexed organization, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp ); function donate(address organization) external payable { require(verifiedOrganizations[organization], \"Organization not verified\"); require(msg.value > 0, \"Donation must be greater than 0\"); organizationBalances[organization] += msg.value; emit DonationReceived( msg.sender, organization, msg.value, block.timestamp ); } function withdraw(uint256 amount) external { require(verifiedOrganizations[msg.sender], \"Not a verified organization\"); require(organizationBalances[msg.sender] >= amount, \"Insufficient balance\"); organizationBalances[msg.sender] -= amount; payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount); } } ``` ## Conversion and Settlement ### Automatic Conversion **Configuration Options:** ```json { \"conversion_settings\": { \"auto_convert\": true, \"target_currency\": \"USD\", \"conversion_threshold\": 10, \"conversion_frequency\": \"immediate\", \"slippage_tolerance\": 0.02 } } ``` **Conversion Flow:** ```mermaid sequenceDiagram participant Donor participant Platform participant Exchange participant Organization Donor->>Platform: Send crypto donation Platform->>Platform: Confirm transaction Platform->>Exchange: Request conversion Exchange->>Exchange: Execute trade Exchange->>Platform: Return fiat value Platform->>Organization: Credit USD account ``` ### Exchange Integration **Liquidity Providers:** ```javascript // Exchange rate aggregation const getExchangeRate = async (currency, amount) => { const providers = [\"coinbase\", \"kraken\", \"binance\"]; const rates = await Promise.all( providers.map((provider) => fetchRate(provider, currency, amount)), ); return { bestRate: Math.max(...rates.map((r) => r.rate)), provider: rates.find( (r) => r.rate === Math.max(...rates.map((r) => r.rate)), ).provider, timestamp: new Date().toISOString(), }; }; ``` ## Security Implementation ### Key Management **Hardware Security Module (HSM):** ```javascript // HSM integration for key storage const { HSMClient } = require(\"@give-protocol/hsm\"); const hsm = new HSMClient({ endpoint: process.env.HSM_ENDPOINT, credentials: { keyId: process.env.HSM_KEY_ID, secret: process.env.HSM_SECRET, }, }); // Generate new wallet const wallet = await hsm.generateKey({ algorithm: \"ECDSA\", curve: \"secp256k1\", label: `org_${organizationId}_wallet`, }); // Sign transaction const signature = await hsm.sign({ keyLabel: wallet.label, message: transactionHash, }); ``` ### Multi-Signature Wallets **Configuration:** ```javascript // Multi-sig setup for high-value transactions const multiSigWallet = { threshold: 2, signers: [\"org_admin_1\", \"org_admin_2\", \"platform_escrow\"], timelock: 86400, // 24 hours dailyLimit: { BTC: 1, ETH: 10, USD: 10000, }, }; ``` ### Transaction Validation **Security Checks:** ```javascript const validateTransaction = async (tx) => { // Check transaction format if (!isValidTransactionFormat(tx)) { throw new Error(\"Invalid transaction format\"); } // Verify signature const isValid = await verifySignature(tx); if (!isValid) { throw new Error(\"Invalid signature\"); } // Check for double-spend const isDuplicate = await checkDoubleSpend(tx); if (isDuplicate) { throw new Error(\"Transaction already processed\"); } // Validate amount limits if (tx.amount > limits[tx.currency]) { throw new Error(\"Amount exceeds limits\"); } return true; }; ``` ## Compliance and Reporting ### KYC/AML Requirements **Threshold-Based Verification:** ```javascript const kycRequirements = { anonymous: { maxUSD: 1000, required: [], }, basic: { maxUSD: 10000, required: [\"email\", \"name\"], }, enhanced: { maxUSD: null, required: [\"email\", \"name\", \"address\", \"id_verification\"], }, }; ``` ### Transaction Reporting **IRS Form 8283 Generation:** ```javascript // Generate tax documentation for crypto donations const generateForm8283 = async (donation) => { const fairMarketValue = await getFMV( donation.currency, donation.amount, donation.timestamp, ); return { donorInfo: donation.donor, organizationInfo: donation.organization, donationDate: donation.timestamp, cryptocurrency: donation.currency, amount: donation.amount, fairMarketValueUSD: fairMarketValue, costBasis: \"Not provided\", method: \"Cryptocurrency donation\", }; }; ``` ### Blockchain Analytics **Transaction Screening:** ```javascript // Integration with blockchain analytics const { ChainAnalysis } = require(\"@give-protocol/compliance\"); const screenTransaction = async (tx) => { const risk = await ChainAnalysis.assess({ address: tx.from, currency: tx.currency, amount: tx.amount, }); if (risk.score > 0.7) { return { action: \"block\", reason: risk.factors, }; } else if (risk.score > 0.4) { return { action: \"review\", reason: risk.factors, }; } return { action: \"approve\" }; }; ``` ## User Interface Components ### Donation Widget ```html <!-- Embeddable donation widget --> <div id=\"give-crypto-widget\" data-organization=\"org_123\" data-currencies=\"BTC,ETH,USDC\" data-theme=\"light\" ></div> <script src=\"https://cdn.give.io/crypto-widget.js\"></script> <script> GiveCrypto.init({ organizationId: \"org_123\", currencies: [\"BTC\", \"ETH\", \"USDC\"], defaultAmount: 100, onComplete: (donation) => { console.log(\"Donation complete:\", donation); }, }); </script> ``` ### QR Code Generation ```javascript // Generate QR codes for crypto addresses const generateQRCode = (address, amount, currency) => { const uri = buildPaymentURI(address, amount, currency); return QRCode.toDataURL(uri, { errorCorrectionLevel: \"H\", type: \"image/png\", width: 256, margin: 2, }); }; // Payment URI formats const buildPaymentURI = (address, amount, currency) => { const formats = { BTC: `bitcoin:${address}?amount=${amount}`, ETH: `ethereum:${address}?value=${amount * 1e18}`, USDC: `ethereum:${USDC_CONTRACT}/transfer?address=${address}&uint256=${amount * 1e6}`, }; return formats[currency]; }; ``` ## Testing and Development ### Testnet Configuration ```javascript // Testnet endpoints const networks = { development: { BTC: \"testnet\", ETH: \"goerli\", endpoints: { BTC: \"https://testnet.blockchain.info\", ETH: \"https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY\", }, }, production: { BTC: \"mainnet\", ETH: \"mainnet\", endpoints: { BTC: \"https://blockchain.info\", ETH: \"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY\", }, }, }; ``` ### Testing Tools **Mock Transactions:** ```javascript // Generate test transactions const createTestTransaction = async (params) => { const faucet = getFaucet(params.currency); const testAddress = await generateTestAddress(); return { txId: generateMockTxId(), from: faucet.address, to: testAddress, amount: params.amount, currency: params.currency, status: \"pending\", confirmations: 0, }; }; ``` ## Performance Optimization ### Caching Strategy ```javascript // Redis caching for exchange rates const getCachedRate = async (currency) => { const cached = await redis.get(`rate:${currency}`); if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < 60000) { return cached.rate; } const rate = await fetchLiveRate(currency); await redis.setex( `rate:${currency}`, 60, JSON.stringify({ rate, timestamp: Date.now() }), ); return rate; }; ``` ### Batch Processing ```javascript // Batch transaction processing const processBatch = async (transactions) => { const grouped = groupBy(transactions, \"currency\"); for (const [currency, txs] of Object.entries(grouped)) { const provider = getProvider(currency); const results = await provider.batchProcess(txs); await Promise.all( results.map((result) => updateTransactionStatus(result.txId, result.status), ), ); } }; ``` ## Support and Resources ### Developer Resources - API Reference: `developers.give.io/crypto` - GitHub Examples: `github.com/give-protocol/crypto-examples` - Testnet Faucets: `faucet.give.io` - Discord Community: `discord.gg/giveprotocol` ### Technical Support - Email: `crypto-support@give.io` - Developer Forum: `forum.give.io/crypto` - Office Hours: Thursdays 2-4 PM EST ### Additional Documentation - Security Best Practices - Regulatory Compliance Guide - Integration Checklist - Performance Benchmarks"

    "content": "This document provides detailed information about Give Protocol's fee structure, including calculation methods, technical implementation, and integration guidelines for developers. ## Overview Give Protocol implements a transparent and competitive fee structure designed to maximize the funds reaching charitable organizations while ensuring platform sustainability. ### Fee Philosophy - **Transparency First**: All fees clearly disclosed - **Competitive Rates**: Lower than traditional payment processors - **No Hidden Costs**: What you see is what you pay - **Value-Based**: Fees reflect the value provided ## Fee Categories ### 1. Platform Fees **Standard Platform Fee: 2.5%** - Applied to all donations - Covers platform operations - Includes basic features - No monthly minimums **Reduced Fee Tiers:** - **Bronze** (>$10K/month): 2.25% - **Silver** (>$50K/month): 2.0% - **Gold** (>$100K/month): 1.75% - **Platinum** (>$500K/month): 1.5% ### 2. Payment Processing Fees **Credit/Debit Cards:** ``` Base Rate: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction International Cards: +1.5% Currency Conversion: +1% ``` **Bank Transfers (ACH):** ``` Flat Fee: $0.50 per transaction No percentage fee 3-5 business day processing ``` **Cryptocurrency:** ``` Network Fees: Variable (paid by sender) Conversion Fee: 1% (if converting to fiat) No platform markup on network fees ``` ### 3. Additional Service Fees **Optional Services:** - **Instant Payouts**: $2.00 per transfer - **International Wire**: $25.00 per transfer - **Chargeback Handling**: $15.00 per incident - **Custom Reporting**: $50.00/month - **API Premium Access**: $100.00/month ## Fee Calculation ### Standard Donation Example ```javascript // Donation amount: $100.00 // Payment method: Credit Card // Organization tier: Standard const donation = 100.0; const platformFee = donation * 0.025; // 2.5% = $2.50 const processingFee = donation * 0.029 + 0.3; // 2.9% + $0.30 = $3.20 const totalFees = platformFee + processingFee; // $5.70 const netToCharity = donation - totalFees; // $94.30 ``` ### Cryptocurrency Donation Example ```javascript // Donation amount: 0.01 BTC (~$450) // Conversion to USD requested // Network fee: Paid by sender const btcAmount = 0.01; const usdValue = btcAmount * 45000; // $450 const conversionFee = usdValue * 0.01; // 1% = $4.50 const platformFee = usdValue * 0.025; // 2.5% = $11.25 const totalFees = conversionFee + platformFee; // $15.75 const netToCharity = usdValue - totalFees; // $434.25 ``` ## Technical Implementation ### Fee Calculation API **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/fees/calculate` **Request:** ```json { \"amount\": 100.0, \"currency\": \"USD\", \"payment_method\": \"card\", \"organization_id\": \"org_123abc\", \"options\": { \"instant_payout\": false, \"convert_crypto\": true } } ``` **Response:** ```json { \"breakdown\": { \"donation_amount\": 100.0, \"platform_fee\": 2.5, \"processing_fee\": 3.2, \"additional_fees\": 0.0, \"total_fees\": 5.7, \"net_amount\": 94.3 }, \"rates\": { \"platform_rate\": 0.025, \"processing_rate\": 0.029, \"processing_fixed\": 0.3 }, \"organization_tier\": \"standard\" } ``` ### Fee Models **Database Schema:** ```sql CREATE TABLE fee_structures ( id UUID PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, platform_rate DECIMAL(5,4) NOT NULL, min_monthly_volume DECIMAL(10,2), max_monthly_volume DECIMAL(10,2), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(), updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() ); CREATE TABLE transaction_fees ( id UUID PRIMARY KEY, transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id), fee_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL, rate DECIMAL(5,4), fixed_amount DECIMAL(10,2), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() ); ``` ### Fee Collection Flow ```mermaid sequenceDiagram participant Donor participant Platform participant Payment participant Organization Donor->>Platform: Initiate donation Platform->>Platform: Calculate fees Platform->>Donor: Show fee breakdown Donor->>Payment: Authorize payment Payment->>Platform: Process full amount Platform->>Platform: Deduct fees Platform->>Organization: Transfer net amount ``` ## Integration Guide ### SDK Implementation **JavaScript SDK:** ```javascript import { GiveProtocol } from \"@give-protocol/sdk\"; const give = new GiveProtocol({ apiKey: \"your_api_key\", }); // Calculate fees before donation const feeBreakdown = await give.fees.calculate({ amount: 100, paymentMethod: \"card\", organizationId: \"org_123\", }); // Create donation with fee coverage option const donation = await give.donations.create({ amount: 100, coverFees: true, // Donor covers fees organizationId: \"org_123\", paymentMethod: \"card\", }); ``` **Python SDK:** ```python from give_protocol import GiveProtocol give = GiveProtocol(api_key='your_api_key') # Calculate fees fee_breakdown = give.fees.calculate( amount=100, payment_method='card', organization_id='org_123' ) # Create donation donation = give.donations.create( amount=100, cover_fees=True, organization_id='org_123', payment_method='card' ) ``` ### Webhook Events **Fee-Related Events:** ```json { \"event\": \"fee.calculated\", \"data\": { \"donation_id\": \"don_abc123\", \"amount\": 100.0, \"fees\": { \"platform\": 2.5, \"processing\": 3.2, \"total\": 5.7 } } } ``` ## Fee Coverage Options ### Donor Fee Coverage Organizations can enable donors to cover fees: ```javascript // Implementation example const donationWithCoveredFees = { baseAmount: 100.0, fees: 5.7, totalCharge: 105.7, netToCharity: 100.0, }; ``` ### Organization Absorption Organizations can choose to absorb fees: ```javascript // Configuration { \"organization_settings\": { \"absorb_platform_fees\": true, \"absorb_processing_fees\": false } } ``` ## Special Considerations ### Nonprofit Discounts **Eligibility Requirements:** - Valid 501(c)(3) status - Annual revenue under $1M - Application approval **Discount Structure:** - 50% off platform fees - Reduced to 1.25% base rate - Same processing fees apply ### High-Volume Processing **Benefits:** - Negotiated rates - Dedicated support - Custom integration - Priority processing **Requirements:** - Minimum $100K monthly volume - 6-month commitment - Annual review ### International Transactions **Additional Considerations:** - Currency conversion fees - Cross-border fees - Local tax implications - Regulatory compliance ## Fee Reporting ### Monthly Statements **Included Information:** - Transaction-level fee details - Summary by fee type - Tier progression tracking - Year-to-date totals ### API Access **Reporting Endpoints:** ``` GET /api/v1/fees/report?start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-01-31 GET /api/v1/fees/summary?period=monthly GET /api/v1/fees/export?format=csv ``` ### Tax Documentation **Available Documents:** - Fee receipts - Annual summaries - 1099-K forms (if applicable) - Detailed transaction logs ## Optimization Strategies ### Reducing Fees 1. **Increase Monthly Volume** - Reach higher tiers - Batch processing - Consolidated campaigns 2. **Payment Method Selection** - Encourage ACH transfers - Promote recurring donations - Offer crypto options 3. **Timing Strategies** - Monthly vs. daily payouts - Bulk processing - Strategic timing ### Implementation Best Practices ```javascript // Optimize for lower fees const optimizeDonation = async (amount, options) => { // Check if ACH is available for lower fees if (amount > 100 && options.achAvailable) { return { method: \"ach\", fee: 0.5, savingsMessage: \"Save $5.20 by using bank transfer\", }; } // Suggest fee coverage for full donation impact if (!options.coveringFees) { const fees = calculateFees(amount, \"card\"); return { suggestion: `Add ${fees} to cover fees?`, impact: \"Ensure 100% goes to charity\", }; } }; ``` ## Compliance and Regulations ### PCI Compliance - Level 1 PCI DSS certified - Secure fee calculation - Encrypted transmission - Regular audits ### Financial Regulations - FinCEN registered - State money transmitter licenses - GDPR compliant - SOC 2 Type II certified ## Support and Resources ### Developer Resources - API documentation: `developers.give.io/fees` - SDK examples: `github.com/give-protocol/examples` - Integration support: `dev-support@give.io` ### Fee Questions - General inquiries: `fees@give.io` - Tier upgrades: `accounts@give.io` - Technical issues: `support@give.io` ### Additional Resources - Fee calculator tool - Integration testing - Sandbox environment - Webhook testing"
